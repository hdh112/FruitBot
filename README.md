# FruitBot
Empathy chatbot implementation that orders fruits.

## Features
### Informal tone
* _FruitBot_ uses informal tone of Korean language - the tone used between friends.
    * This setting was intended to consider the chatbot as a **friend**, rather than a passive assistant.
* Examples:
```
안녕!        //  Hi!
어서와 :D    //  Welcome :D
반가워~      //  Good to see you :)
```
```
지금 주문할 수 있는 과일은 다음과 같아!
[방울토마토 / 복숭아 / 블루베리 / 사과 / 자몽 / 체리 / 컵과일 / 포도 / 딸기]

For now, you can order the following fruit options!
[Cherry tomatoes / Peaches / Blueberries / Apples / Grapefruits / Cherries / Fruit cups / Grapes / Strawberries]
```
```
고민 된다면 기분이나 필요에 따라 아래 특징 중에 얘기해주면, 그에 맞춰 추천해줄게 ㅎㅎ
[간편함 / 가격 / 양 / 크기 / 맛]

If nothing particular comes up in your mind, you can tell me what you want or need according to the following. I'll recommend an option based on it :D
[Convenient / Price / Quantity / Size / Taste]
```

### Does not force to order
* _FruitBot_ does not always lead the user to order fruits.
    * This way, the user feels less pressure when talking with _FruitBot_. The user can just chat with _FruitBot_, and does not always need to order fruits when having a conversation.
    * As users have less burden, this leads users to chat more frequently with _FruitBot_.
